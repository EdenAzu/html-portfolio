<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eden and I'm 25 year old's. I graduated about a month ago with my first degree, a degree in Computer Science at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Academy. Now, I'm looking for my first job as a software engineer or backend developer. While I am looking for a job, I decided to expand my knowledge, and I also decided to study the front field and especially the full-stack field so that I could look for jobs in another field to.</p>
<p>I have two amazing parents and three sisters, and most of my family is involved in the world of sports and a healthy lifestyle (me too, I am a fitness trainer). My future husband and I like to play tennis a lot together and in general you will not see us go a week without training.</p>
